Hello there! üëã

I'm Ed Fish, a **Senior Research Fellow** at the Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing (CVSSP) at the University of Surrey, where I work on computer vision for video understanding with [Professor Richard Bowden](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/richard-bowden) in the Cognitive Vision Group.

I recently completed my PhD in Efficient Multi-Modal Video Understanding, supervised by Dr. Andrew Gilbert. My research interest is primarily **Video understanding**, specifically with applications in accessibility. Currently I am focussed on applied research in Automated Sign Language Translation as part of the EPSRC project "Sign GPT" alongside work on AI for efficient Sign Language Annotation funded by Google.org.

If you are interested in a PhD in our lab I would be happy to chat with you about opportunities and guide you through the application process.

You can find my [publications](/publications/) and [CV](/cv/) here.
